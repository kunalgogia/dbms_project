        <p>This contract and agreement is entered on___________,
            between the Innocent Souls Veterinary Hospital and Care Center,
            and_________________________________________(collectively "Adopter"),
            Address_____________________phone__________________<br/><br/>
            Adopter has selected an animal from the Hospital as described herein, and
            Adopter desires to adopt such animal and provide a home for the animal, and the Hospital is
            agreeable to such adoption, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.<br/><br/>
            1. The Animal which the Adopter desires to and has agreed to adopt, is described in
            Exhibit "A" attached to and made a part of this Agreement.<br/><br/>
            2. Adopter agrees to keep the Animal in his/her personal possession and control, and shall
            provide proper and sufficient quantities of food and water, and provide shelter, medical attention as needed,
            grooming, sanitation, exercise, safety and humane treatment at all times.<br/><br/>
            3. Adopter agrees not to sell, trade, transfer ownership, abandon, or dispose of the Animal
            in any way. If for any reason the Adopter is not able to keep the Animal or properly care for it.
            Adopter shall contact the Hospital and agrees to relinquish custody of the Animal back to the
            Hospital.<br/><br/>
            4. If the Animal becomes sick or injured, Adopter shall promptly seek veterinary care for
            the animal.<br/><br/>
            5. If the Animal has not been spayed or neutered at the time of adoption, Adopter will not
            allow the Animal to breed or be bred under any circumstances. Adopter further agrees to have the
            Animal spayed or neutered at scheduled time at the Hospital, or shall provide the
            Hospital with proof and verification of such procedure by sending a photocopy of veterinarian
            records to the Hospital not later than _____ days from the date of such scheduled time.<br/><br/>
            6. If the Animal is a cat or kitten, Adopter agrees to never permit or allow the
            Animal to be declawed under any circumstances. Adopter understands that declawing is viewed
            as mutilation. In the event that Adopter breaches or violates this provision, the Hospital
            may remove the Animal from Adopter, and bring an action for breach of contract.<br/><br/>
            7. Adopter shall provide current ID tags for the Animal, secured to collar, and which is
            worn at all times. Microchipping is recommended as a means of permanent identification of
            ownership of the animal.<br/><br/>
            8. The Adopter agrees to comply with all state and local laws pertaining to animal
            ownership.<br/><br/>
            9. Adopter understands that failing or refusing to comply with applicable licensing
            agreement could cause Adopter to become subject to penalties. It is
            recommended that the Adopter of any dog over six months of age in the country, or any city therein
            should obtain a license from Innocent Souls Veterinary Hospital and Care Center.<br/><br/>
            10. While all reasonable efforts are made to evaluate the temperament and health of an
            animal adoption prospect, the Hospial makes no guarantee concerning the health and
            temperament of this animal.<br/><br/>
            11. The Adopter agrees to and does hereby assume all risk and responsibility of ownership
            for the Animal after it is in the Adopter's possession, and further agrees to defend, hold harmless and
            indemnify ISVHACC against any and all claims for damages
            arising out of the Adopter's adoption and ownership of the Animal, and any damages caused or
            allegedly caused by the Animal.<br/><br/>
            12. If the Animal is found running beyond the boundaries of Adopter's yard, or if needed veterinarian care is or has
            been ignored, the Adopter agrees to relinquish the Animal to the Hospital, and such
            relinquishment may become permanent if the Hospital determines, in its sole judgment, that
            the home being provided to the Animal by the Adopter is insufficient or inadequate.<br/><br/>
            13. If the Animal adoption becomes unsatisfactory for the Adopter for any reason and the
            Adopter elects to bring the Animal back to the Hospital as understood and stated in this
            Agreement, the Adopter understands that there shall be absolutely no refunds or reimbursement for
            any costs or expenses incurred by Adopter relating to the Adoption or care of the Animal, and no
            trades or exchanges for any other animals.<br/><br/>
            14. Adopter shall pay to Hospital all damages, costs, and expenses, including
            reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by Hospital in seeking recovery of damages
            caused by any action of Adopter in violation of, or in obtaining injunctive relief for the
            enforcement of, any of the provisions of this Agreement.<br/><br/>
